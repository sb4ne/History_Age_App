IMAD Assignment 1 Essay
The purpose of the app I coded was essentially to compare the user’s age to that of a famous historical figure. It can interactively educate and or inspire the user with the interesting facts and information.
 When designing the user interface, I considered that it must be inclusive of people from vastly different age groups. With that in mind the user interface is designed in a way that is easy to use as all the buttons, prompts and heading are written in a larger more visible font for the demographics that are visually impaired. The user interface for the ‘History Age App’ makes use of brighter colours for the buttons, a bold font for the heading/name of the app and an interesting, history themed, background to keep the user intrigued in the app. 
To also help keep the attention of the user, some of the outputs (historical figure facts) have an added element of humour without being offensive or distasteful.
